## Testing code and TDD
_Andrew Potter_

Why it is so vital. Best practices and how to improve your code using this methodology.


## What is testing?

It may seem obvious. Testing is where we test our software to see if it works properly.


## Why we test ?

* It helps us to find errors in our code, especially when refactoring.


## Why we test ?

* Living documentation for your code. How it works and how to invoke your code.


## Why we test ?

* To cover many different scenarios in an automated fashion which will take hours to test manually.


## TDD: A feedback loop

* Test-driven development; a feedback loop,
* Before writing a single line of code have a failing test.


## TDD; Don't think of the code!

* Don't think of the code in your head before writing the test


## TDD; minimal code

* Once you have written the test, then write the minimal code needed to pass the test.


## TDD; design emerges

* Finally you will have the design emerge through the refactoring of the code.


## TDD; Remove duplication

This method of development allows us to continually refactor until all duplication is removed.
